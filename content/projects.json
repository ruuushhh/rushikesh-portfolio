    "action": "Refactored into direct export paths per integration with isolated error handling, retry logic, and dedicated logging. Implemented Django Q2 for efficient task queuing.",
    "result": "Reduced cross-integration failures, improved error isolation, and cut debugging time significantly. Each integration can now fail independently without affecting others.",
